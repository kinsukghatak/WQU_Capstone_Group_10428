### This repo contains the codes for the data prep, EDA and modelling for the WQU - Capstone project for Group : 10428

We intend to perform the following tasks and analysis in sequence: 
- Exatract and process stock market indices data by conencting to Yahoo Finance
- Perform extensive EDA on the data by studying the correlation and co-movement relationship between the selected indices before and after the Covid-19 pandemic.
- Perform regime change analysis and detailed statistical distribution analysis to draw conclusions based on behaviour , trends and returns from the key indices.
- Investigate the associated sectorial indices of the selected indices to understand the relationship between the key sectors of the economy. We will primarily focus on sectors like healthcare, financials, manufacturing and technology.
- Along with the EDA and correlation studies, we will also explore clustering technique to explore if groups or segments can be formed using the sub sectoral index returns.
