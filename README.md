# WQU_Capstone_Group_10428
### This repo contains the codes for the data prep, EDA and modelling for the WQU - Capstone project for Group : 10428

We intend to perform the following tasks and analysis in sequence: 
- Exatract and process stock market indices data by conencting to Yahoo Finance
- Perform extensive EDA on the data by studying the correlation and co-movement relationship between the selected indices before and after the Covid-19 pandemic.
- Perform regime change analysis and detailed statistical distribution analysis to draw conclusions based on behaviour , trends and returns from the key indices.
- Additionally, we will investigate multiple sectoral indices and perform a clustering using k-means on them to understand scopes of investment segments for better return and risk hedging 
- Along with the EDA and correlation studies, we will also explore clustering technique to explore if groups or segments can be formed using the sub sectoral index returns.
